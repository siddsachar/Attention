    "3. **Compute Attention Scores**\n",
    "   - An empty tensor `example_attention_scores` is created to store the attention scores for each embedding.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **How Does It Work?**\n",
    "   - The operation `example_input_embeddings @ example_input_embeddings.T` multiplies the input matrix by its transpose.\n",
    "   - Each entry $(i, j)$ in the resulting matrix is the dot product between the $i$-th query and the $j$-th embedding.\n",
    "   - This produces a square matrix where rows represent queries and columns represent embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code Explanation**\n",
    "   - `@` is the matrix multiplication operator in PyTorch (equivalent to `torch.matmul`).\n",
    "   - The result, `all_attention_scores`, contains all possible query-embedding dot products.\n",
    "   - The matrix is printed to show the computed attention scores.\n",

    "   - This enables the model to capture relationships between all tokens in the input.\n",

    "\n",
    "This cell demonstrates how to apply causal masking to the attention weights in a self-attention mechanism, a technique commonly used in autoregressive models such as GPT and Transformer decoders. Causal masking ensures that each position in a sequence can only attend to itself and previous positions, preventing information \"leakage\" from future tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps and Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute Queries and Keys**\n",
    "    - The input embeddings are projected into query and key spaces using the trained linear layers from the `SelfAttentionv2` module.\n",
    "    - These projections are used to calculate attention scores, which measure the similarity between each query and key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Attention Weights**\n",
    "    - Attention scores are scaled by the square root of the key dimension to stabilize gradients.\n",
    "    - The softmax function is applied to the scaled scores, producing attention weights that sum to 1 for each query.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Apply the Mask**\n",
    "    - The attention weights are element-wise multiplied by the causal mask, zeroing out any weights that correspond to future positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Normalize Masked Attention Weights**\n",
    "    - After masking, the attention weights for each query may no longer sum to 1.\n",
    "    - The masked weights are renormalized by dividing each row by its sum, ensuring they form a valid probability distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Autoregressive Generation:** Causal masking is essential for tasks like language modeling and text generation, where predictions for each token should not depend on future tokens.\n",

Dropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting by randomly zeroing out elements of a tensor during training. In the context of attention mechanisms, dropout is commonly applied to the attention weights to improve generalization and model robustness.\n",

    "- **Preventing Overfitting:** Dropout helps the model avoid relying too heavily on specific attention connections, encouraging it to learn more robust and distributed representations.\n",

    "# Causal Masking in Batched Self-Attention Modules: Detailed Explanation\n",
    "This cell defines a custom PyTorch module, `CausalAttention`, which implements self-attention with causal masking and dropout for batched input sequences. This approach is essential for autoregressive models, such as GPT and Transformer decoders, where each token should only attend to itself and previous tokens, not future ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps and Concepts\n",
    "1. **Module Initialization**\n",
    "   - The module takes `input_dim`, `output_dim`, `dropout`, `context_length`, and an optional `qkv_bias` as arguments.\n",
    "   - Three linear layers are created for projecting input embeddings into queries, keys, and values.\n",
    "   - A dropout layer is initialized for regularization.\n",
    "   - The causal mask is registered as a buffer, using an upper-triangular matrix to identify future positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forward Pass**\n",
    "   - The input tensor `x` is expected to have shape `[batch_size, num_tokens, input_dim]`.\n",
    "   - Queries, keys, and values are computed for each token in the batch using the respective linear layers.\n",
    "   - Attention scores are calculated as the dot product between queries and keys, resulting in a `[batch_size, num_tokens, num_tokens]` matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Causal Masking**\n",
    "   - The causal mask is sliced to match the current sequence length (`num_tokens`).\n",
    "   - `attention_scores.masked_fill_(self.causal_mask.bool()[:num_tokens, :num_tokens], -torch.inf)` sets attention scores for future positions to negative infinity.\n",
    "   - This ensures that, after softmax, each token can only attend to itself and previous tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scaling and Softmax**\n",
    "   - Attention scores are scaled by the square root of the key dimension to stabilize gradients.\n",
    "   - Softmax is applied along the last dimension, converting scores into attention weights that sum to 1 for each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dropout Regularization**\n",
    "   - Dropout is applied to the attention weights, randomly zeroing out some connections during training to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Context Vector Computation**\n",
    "   - The final context vectors are computed as a weighted sum of the value vectors, using the masked and regularized attention weights.\n",
    "   - The output is a tensor of shape `[batch_size, num_tokens, output_dim]`, suitable for further processing in sequence models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Importance\n",
    "- **Autoregressive Modeling:** Causal masking is critical for tasks like language modeling and sequence generation, ensuring predictions for each token do not depend on future tokens.\n",
    "- **Efficient Batch Processing:** The module supports batched inputs, making it suitable for training and inference on large datasets.\n",
    "- **Regularization:** Dropout improves generalization by preventing the model from relying too heavily on specific attention connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "- The module returns context vectors for each token in the batch, with causality and regularization enforced.\n",
    "- This implementation is a robust building block for modern Transformer-based architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell demonstrates how to combine causal masking and dropout in a modular, batched self-attention layer, providing both theoretical rigor and practical utility for deep learning models."

    "\n",
    "3. **Module Instantiation**\n",

    "# Multi-Head Attention: Batched Context Vector Computation and Output Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell demonstrates how to use the `MultiHeadAttention` module to compute context vectors for a batch of input sequences using multi-head causal self-attention. Multi-head attention is a key component of Transformer architectures, allowing the model to capture diverse relationships in the input data by attending to different representation subspaces in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps and Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Seed Initialization**\n",
    "    - The random seed is set for reproducibility, ensuring that the initialization of weights and dropout patterns is consistent across runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parameter Setup**\n",
    "    - `input_dim`: The dimensionality of each input embedding (here, 3).\n",
    "    - `output_dim`: The total output dimension after concatenating all attention heads (here, 6).\n",
    "    - `dropout`: The dropout probability (here, 0.2), used to regularize the attention weights.\n",
    "    - `context_length`: The number of tokens in each input sequence (here, 6).\n",
    "    - `num_heads`: The number of parallel attention heads (here, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Module Instantiation**\n",
    "    - The `MultiHeadAttention` module is instantiated with the specified parameters.\n",
    "    - Internally, the module creates separate linear layers for query, key, and value projections, splits the output dimension across multiple heads, applies causal masking to enforce autoregressive behavior, and includes a final output projection layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Forward Pass**\n",
    "    - The batched input embeddings (`batched_input_embeddings`) are passed through the multi-head attention module.\n",
    "    - For each sequence in the batch, the module computes queries, keys, and values for each head, applies causal masking to prevent attention to future tokens, calculates scaled dot-product attention scores, normalizes them with softmax, applies dropout, and computes context vectors by aggregating the value vectors.\n",
    "    - The outputs from all heads are concatenated and projected to the final output dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output**\n",
    "    - The resulting `context_vectors` tensor has shape `[batch_size, context_length, output_dim]`, representing the aggregated information for each token in each sequence, with contributions from all attention heads.\n",
    "    - The output is printed for inspection, allowing you to analyze how multi-head attention distributes focus across the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expressive Representations:** Multi-head attention enables the model to learn and represent complex dependencies in the input data by attending to different aspects in parallel.\n",
    "- **Autoregressive Modeling:** Causal masking ensures that each token only attends to itself and previous tokens, which is essential for tasks like language modeling and sequence generation.\n",
    "- **Regularization:** Dropout helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping attention connections during training.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** The module efficiently processes batched inputs and supports flexible configuration of head and output dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell provides a complete example of applying multi-head causal attention to batched input sequences, highlighting the advantages of parallel attention mechanisms and demonstrating how to integrate them into modern deep learning workflows."
